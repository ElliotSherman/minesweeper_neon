# minesweeper_neon

## A re-Designed version of the classic minesweeper game

In this project i used HTML,CSS and JS, fontawesome and basic neighbour loops setTimeout and setInterval functions.  The design is by yours truly ðŸ«¡, i just thought that the original game design is too dull, so i decided to go with something that i imagined in my head using my (i guess embedded) creativity and give Life to my imagination, i really like the result of the design i have invisioned although this is not the Final product but i believe that i have reached the point making this project worthy of sharing or at least posting on my github pins.  

### feel free to contact me with your thoughts about this project or just give me a job LOL ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ 
## happy coding
